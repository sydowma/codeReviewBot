   - Are the methods and classes concise, and does each adhere to the single responsibility principle?
   - Are the comments clear, necessary, and accurate?
2. **Logic and Functionality**
   - Does the code work as expected, and do all functionalities operate correctly?
   - Are there any unhandled edge cases or potential bugs?
   - Is there a more efficient or simpler way to implement the logic?
3. **Performance and Efficiency**
   - Is there room for improving the performance of the code?
   - Are there any parts of the code that could lead to performance bottlenecks?
4. **Testing**
   - Does the code include sufficient unit tests?
